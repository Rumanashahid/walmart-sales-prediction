## Walmart Sales Prediction and Demand Forecasting
Project Overview
This project aims to predict sales and demand for Walmart stores using historical sales data from 45 stores across the United States. By analyzing the impact of various factors such as holidays, fuel prices, and temperature on sales, the project provides valuable insights that help in inventory management, demand forecasting, and sales strategies. Multiple machine learning models are employed, and their performances are compared to achieve the most accurate predictions.

## Project Objectives
Sales Prediction: Forecast weekly sales for individual Walmart stores based on historical data.
Feature Engineering: Create new features such as Holiday_Temperature and combine existing ones like Fuel_Price and CPI for better model performance.
Model Evaluation: Compare the performance of several machine learning models such as Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Ensemble methods to find the best approach.
## Dataset
The dataset contains historical sales data from Walmart stores across 45 locations, with the following features:

Store: Store number
Date: Week of the sales
Weekly_Sales: Sales for the week
Temperature: Weather conditions at the time of sales
Fuel_Price: Fuel prices at the time of sales
CPI: Consumer Price Index
Unemployment: Unemployment rate
Holiday_Flag: Whether the week includes a holiday (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
## Key Steps
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature selection.
Feature Engineering: Creation of new features like Holiday_Temperature and combining Fuel_Price with CPI for better predictions.
Data Normalization/Scaling: Standardizing continuous features such as Temperature, Fuel_Price, and CPI.
## Model Building: Training and testing multiple models like:
# Multiple Linear Regression
# Decision Tree Regressor
# Random Forest Regressor
# Ensemble methods
## Model Evaluation: Analyzing model performance using metrics such as RMSE, R², and MAE to select the best model.
## Results and Insights
Feature Importance: Identified the most influential features affecting sales (e.g., holidays, fuel prices).
Model Comparison: Evaluated models and determined that Random Forest performed best with an RMSE of X and R² of Y.
Sales Trends: Discovered key sales patterns around holiday periods and specific temperature ranges.
## Technologies Used
Python: For data analysis and machine learning (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn).
Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive coding and visualization.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Machine Learning Models: Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Ensemble techniques.
